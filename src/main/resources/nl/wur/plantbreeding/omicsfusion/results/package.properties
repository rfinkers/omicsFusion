#Summary table
results.summary.introduction=<p>Summary table including the overall ranked results of all run methods. The results table is divided into several categories; namely: univariate methods (purple header), machine learning techniques (red header), penalized methods without variable selection (green header), and penalized methods with variable selection (yellow header).</p><p>An overall rank is calculated for each of the response variables and the resulting table is ordered accordingly. The rank for individual tests can be obtained by hovering over the coefficients. To quickly scan the results, the background of each coefficient is color coded (most significant: blue to less/not significant: white).</p>
