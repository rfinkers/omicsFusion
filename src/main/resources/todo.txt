- Add storage of user details / selected procedures / sessionid to the database
- Show the version of the (System details /) R packages on a page?

Solve (in part) NxP problem. 

Univariate, with FDR                Single      rank
Principal component regression      All         rank
PLS                                 All         rank
sPLS                                <P          rank & selection
Ridge regression                    All         rank
Lasso regression                    <N          rank & selection
Elestic net                         <p          rank & selection
Support vector machine regression               mostly selection
random forest                       Often all   mostly rank
    -> using GenesRF: classification with RF

Could you send me the program that you have now used for the paper. Please also make a copy of the program in a folder with a name that makes clear
that this was the exact version with which the results included in the paper were generated. Then also copy the exact data files as you used them as
input for the program to this folder and (in a separate sub-folder) the raw results files and the processed results files that you used to make the
tables and figures. Once you have a submitted version of the paper, make sure that you store all the tables and figures and the exact version of the
paper that was submitted, to a folder also. The idea is that if people later on have questions that you should not have too much trouble in finding back
the exact program, input and results. Make also a backup of these. For your own sake, it will be good to keep track of the exact submitted version of
the paper, as this is the one you will be working on later on if the referees or the editors have comments, additional input is required etc.

For the future I think we will need a version of the program that can:

* Perform all methods as you used them: univariate, univariate with FDR correction, lasso, ridge, enet, pcr, pls, spls, rf, svm
* In a double cross validation scheme (optimization parameters, estimation of prediction error, also produce a final model using all the data)
* MSEP estimation, R2-training, R2-test, ranks of the variables, estimates of regression coefficients, and absolute values of these regression
  coefficients (for ranking regardless of the plus or minus sign), predicted response per method, selected set of variables (their identification).
* Variation in these measures over the iterations, sd for the MSEP, R2, but also variation in the numbers of variables selected, the ranks of variables,
  consistency of the top 1, top 5, top 10, top 20, etc. over the iterations.

* At some stage: a permutation test, to establish significance for the variables, to create a null hypothesis distribution for all the parameters of
  interest (What R2, MSEP etc can still be obtained in a permuted data set?) to help us to know whether the result really has significance, relevance, biological meaning.
* At some stage: the possibility to run the software with different choices for centering and autoscaling of the y and the x variables.
* At some stage: Easy formatting of the output results. Good summary files. Especially the importance of variables should be clear, not just in the estimates
  but also visually (maybe colour like I did for Martijn Eggink), the output and visualisation should also help the comparison of the variables across methods.
* At some stage: Easy and clear visualization of the results. Good graphs, tables, diagrams.
* At some stage: Automated calculation of correlations among the 1) selected variables from variable selection procedures, 2) top something of the ranking procedures or,
  3) a 'significant' set of variables based on permutation results.
* Maybe: a bootstrap procedure to assess variability ? Maybe not necessary with the cross validation scheme.

In addition we will need a clear description of all the methods with all their pros and cons (advantages, disadvantages, peculiarities, behaviour),
not just from a theoretical perspective but also for guidance in the application by non-statistical users. It will have to include sort of a recommendation:
if this and this is your situation and you are interested in this and this type of biological question then you should use this and this method and certainly
not that and that method. The paper should actually already contain most of this information, so that a reference will be also good.
